### Excel Dashboard Project: Customer, Product, and Revenue Analysis

In this project, I developed three interactive dashboards in Excel to provide actionable insights into customer behavior, product performance, and revenue trends. These dashboards were designed to help businesses make informed decisions regarding sales strategies, inventory management, and financial planning.

#### **Dashboard 1: Customer & Product Analysis**
1. **Customer Analysis**: 
   - Detailed insights into profit generation by male and female customers.
   - Breakdown of average spending across different age groups, highlighting the most profitable segments.
2. **Profitability Over Time**: 
   - A profit trend analysis with month-over-month growth rates, revealing seasonal sales patterns and helping optimize sales strategies.
3. **Profitability by Weekday**: 
   - Insights into which days of the week generate the most profit, valuable for staffing, scheduling, and targeted marketing.
4. **Product Analysis**: 
   - Top-selling and most profitable products, alongside product return and refund rates, critical for managing inventory and identifying key revenue drivers.

#### **Dashboard 2: Store Performance**
1. **Store Budget vs Revenue**: 
   - Comparative analysis of actual revenue versus targets for each store, helping identify under or over-performing stores.
2. **Month-by-Month Analysis**: 
   - A month-by-month breakdown of revenue versus targets, highlighting variances for better financial planning and performance tracking.

#### **Dashboard 3: Revenue Trend Analysis**
1. **Quarterly Revenue Analysis**: 
   - Revenue per quarter compared against the average, giving a quick view of overall performance relative to expectations.
2. **Weekday vs Weekend Revenue**: 
   - Comparison of weekday versus weekend revenue to help make informed decisions about staffing and operations.
3. **Monthly Revenue vs Target**: 
   - Monthly tracking of revenue against set targets, crucial for adjusting financial strategies and short-term planning.

This project showcases my ability to create visually appealing and insightful dashboards using Excel, turning raw data into valuable insights that help businesses optimize operations, improve profitability, and plan effectively.
